# Adblock Plus - Vietnam List #
An Adblock Plus filters list which is supplemental to EasyList to help block advertisements on websites from Vietnam. **Ads were yesterday... in Vietnam!**

  * 7/4/2009: [Rick752 - maintainer of the EasyList - passed away on 4/4](http://adblockplus.org/blog/sad-news). That's sad. Rick and others helped me a lot to optimize my filters list. I'd like to give my condolences to his family, friends and others people involved in Adblock Plus project.

## More Info ##
  * **Adblock Plus**: an extension for Firefox, helps blocking advertisements on websites. **Moreover, the blocked ads are not downloaded, and that makes pages load faster for dial-up users in Vietnam.** Download at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

  * **EasyList, EasyElement**: global filters lists for Adblock Plus. **Adblock Pro for Internet Explorer (IE) uses a ripped version of these filters lists** [[1](http://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3062&sid=84f60f42e73c6fda49f512f138558a8a)].

  * You only need to subscribe to a subscription list once, then Adblock Plus will auto update it when there are new changes later. You won't have to manually add your own filters.

  * If there are false positives, or if you have filters suggestions, just notify us. When we update the list, not only you but everyone will benefit from it :)
