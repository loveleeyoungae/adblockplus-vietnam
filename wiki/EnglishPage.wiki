= Adblock Plus - Vietnam List =
An Adblock Plus filters list which is supplemental to !EasyList to help block advertisements on websites from Vietnam. *Ads were yesterday... in Vietnam!* 

  * 7/4/2009: [http://adblockplus.org/blog/sad-news Rick752 - maintainer of the EasyList - passed away on 4/4]. That's sad. Rick and others helped me a lot to optimize my filters list. I'd like to give my condolences to his family, friends and others people involved in Adblock Plus project.

==More Info==
  * *Adblock Plus*: an extension for Firefox, helps blocking advertisements on websites. *Moreover, the blocked ads are not downloaded, and that makes pages load faster for dial-up users in Vietnam.* Download at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865

  * *!EasyList, !EasyElement*: global filters lists for Adblock Plus. *Adblock Pro for Internet Explorer (IE) uses a ripped version of these filters lists* [http://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3062&sid=84f60f42e73c6fda49f512f138558a8a [1]].

  * You only need to subscribe to a subscription list once, then Adblock Plus will auto update it when there are new changes later. You won't have to manually add your own filters.

  * BKIS is blocked to prevent some suspicious activities, reported in [http://vozforums.com/showthread.php?t=201491 1], [http://vozforums.com/showthread.php?t=155275 2], [http://vozforums.com/showthread.php?t=198579 3], [http://ddth.com/showthread.php?t=238660 4], [http://ddth.com/showthread.php?t=235864 5]. Please remember, our list is not even compared to !EasyList, it's just a personal list, and as !IceDogg said "ABP is about you choosing what you don't want to see, not a government or agency."

  * If there are false positives, or if you have filters suggestions, just notify us. When we update the list, not only you but everyone will benefit from it :)
